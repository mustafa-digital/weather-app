# Weather App

This app provides current, hourly, and 3-day forecast weather information using WeatherAPI.
The user can search for a location using the searchbar, and autocomplete suggestions are provided using API calls from the user input.
If no location is found for the user search, an alert will be given that the location was not found.

## Lessons Learned:

- Used fetch API to make API requests
- Async functions to asynchronously retrieve data from an API and then work with retrieved data
- Parsing JSON data to get the data I needed
- Refactoring code into multiple modules and methods to make code more maintainable and readable
